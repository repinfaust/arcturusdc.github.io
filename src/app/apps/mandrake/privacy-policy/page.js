        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Arcturus Digital Consulting Ltd</strong>
        (“Arcturus Digital Consulting”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects
        information when you use the <strong>Mandrake</strong> mobile application (the “App”).

          <strong>On-device app data (no account required):</strong> your in-app settings,

          leave your device unless you back it up with your OS features or share it with us
          (e.g., via support email).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Crash/diagnostics:</strong> your operating system or app store may provide
          anonymised crash and performance reports which we use to improve stability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Support communications:</strong> if you contact us, we process the information
          you provide to resolve your request.

        <li>To operate core features of the App on your device.</li>

        <li>To provide user support and respond to enquiries.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) Legal bases (UK/EU)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> running and improving the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where required by your platform settings (e.g., device permissions you opt in to).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Data storage and retention</h2>
      <p>
        App data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App.
        Support emails are retained only as long as needed for support and for
        reasonable business, legal or audit purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>5) Sharing and transfers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data.</li>
        <li>We may use service providers (e.g., crash analytics) under contracts with appropriate safeguards.</li>
        <li>We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights/safety.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6) Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Mandrake is intended for users aged <strong>16+</strong> and not directed to children under 13.

# Decisions

## Ruby build spec decisions
- Ruby is positioned as the product intelligence layer across STEa apps (Ruby, Harls, Filo, Hans).
- TipTap is the authoring core with uploads, slash commands, and rich block support.
- DocLink graph is the primary traceability model between docs and artifacts.
- Prompt-to-doc uses MCP templates for PRS, build spec, and release notes.
- Reviewer Mode and release notes automation are planned as quality gates.
- Delivery is phased with stage gates (architecture, security/privacy, UAT, release).
